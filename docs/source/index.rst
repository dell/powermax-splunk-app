Welcome to the official PowerMax for Splunk documentation!
==========================================================

Overview
--------
PowerMax for Splunk provides Splunk users with a backend Technology Add-on (TA)
and sample frontend app to simplify interaction with Splunk Enterprise environments.

The Splunk Technology Add-on for PowerMax allows a Splunk Enterprise
administrator to collect inventory, performance information, alert, and audit
log information from VMAX/PowerMax storage arrays. The TA is a wrapper
around the opensource library PyU4V_, providing programmatic access to the
Unisphere for PowerMax REST API.  You can directly analyse data use it as a
contextual data feed to correlate with other operational or security data in
Splunk Enterprise.

The sample Splunk App for Dell EMC PowerMax allows a Splunk Enterprise
administrator to view data from PowerMax arrays through the TA and present
them in pre-built dashboards, tables, and time charts for in-depth analysis.

The TA and App can be downloaded from the links below:

- `Dell EMC PowerMax Add-on for Splunk Enterprise`_
- `Dell EMC PowerMax App for Splunk Enterprise`_

From the PowerMax for Splunk 3.x release code for both the TA and app will be
actively managed and maintained from the public Dell GitHub repo. The source
for both code can be viewed and downloaded from the links below:

.. note::
    To get full support of all features in PowerMax for Splunk 3.x you will
    need to have your array u-code at level 5978.7xx.xxx (Hickory SR) or newer
    and use both Solutions Enabler 9.2.1 and Unisphere for PowerMax 9.2.1.
    PowerMax for Splunk uses new efficiency statistics which are only available
    in the Hickory SR release. If your array is lower than 5978.7xx.xxx then
    these statistics will not be reported on in PowerMax for Splunk.

.. note::
    PowerMax for Splunk has been tested and verified only against Python 3.x.
    There is **no** support for Python 2.x, it reached end-of-life in
    January 2020.

Build your own Docs
-------------------
PowerMax for Splunk docs have been included with the PowerMax for Splunk TA and
App source code, if you would like to build the docs from scratch to view
locally use the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install sphinx
   $ pip install sphinx-rtd-theme
   $ cd {powermax_for_splunk}/docs
   $ make clean && make html

All of the necessary ``make`` files and Sphinx configuration files are included
with PowerMax for Splunk so you can build the docs after the required
dependencies have been installed.

Once the above commands have been run you will find newly generated html files
within the ``{powermax_for_splunk}/docs/build`` folder. Open ``index.html``
within a browser of your choosing to view the docs offline. Generating the docs
is not required, we have bundled the most up-to-date docs with PowerMax for
Splunk so you can still navigate to
``{powermax_for_splunk}/docs/build/index.html`` within your browser to view
PowerMax for Splunk docs offline.
