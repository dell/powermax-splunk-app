- Add .readthedocs.yaml file required for building project on Read the Docs

  by users to build out their own custom dashboards

PowerMax for Splunk 3.0 - 15th February 2021
============================================
- New categories have been added:
    - Masking View
    - IP Interface
    - iSCSI Target
    - Snapshot Policies
    - RDF Groups
    - Metro DR
    - Audit Logs
- The TA has been completely overhauled to integrate PyU4V to provide all
  required Unisphere for PowerMax REST API functionality.
- Users can now specify if they want to collect all metrics, key-performance
  indicator (KPI) metrics, or a custom set of metrics for each supported
  category in the PowerMax for Splunk TA.
- The now retired VMAX for Splunk sizer has been removed as a standalone
  script from the PowerMax for Splunk TA in favour of integrating its
  functionality directly into the TA. Now when a collection run exceeds the
  interval set for a given data input a warning message will appear in the
  logs along with a recommended interval to set.
- The TA has multiple code efficiency improvements to move to hash lookups over
  list iterations and use dictionaries and sets over lists where possible.
- The TA now has a full suite of unit tests and CI tests with full coverage of
  all code to improve reliability of submitted code and any future fixes.
- The TA now conforms to PEP8 and PyLint industry Python coding standards.
- The App has been redesigned so it will run entirely on KPI metrics. This is
  to cut down on the amount of data ingested into Splunk without impacting the
  functionality of the front end app.
- The App dashboard filter parameters are now bi-directional, they can be
  selected in any order and all other filter options will update accordingly to
  keep searches valid for your environment.
- The App dashboard charts have been set to use logarithmic scale on the y-axis
  instead of linear, this allows for better visualisation of results when there
  is a wide range on the y-axis.
- Documentation has had a complete redesign and is now also hosted on
  readthedocs.io.
